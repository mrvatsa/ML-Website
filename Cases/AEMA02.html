            <ul class="description">
                <li>As per the PMS, the Emergency generator on load test (Gen + ACB) was carried out.</li>
                <li>ESBD was de-energized by opening the ESBD Tie-Breaker ACB using the RTS.</li>
                <li>The Generator started and came on load as per the regulations, and everything was satisfactory.</li>
                <li>When RTS turned to Normal, the Emergency  Generator got off-loaded. The ESBD Tie breaker failed to close.</li>
                <li>- The system tried multiple closing attempts but failed to close the Tie Breaker.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Solution Summary</h2>
            <ul class="description">
                <li>The ship carried out the maintenance of the Tie-breaker ACB. The problem still persisted.</li>
                <li>Shore assistance was sought out, and electrical circuits were referred to.</li>
                <li>A step-by-step examination of components was done by the ship to ensure proper functioning.</li>
                <li>Multiple timers are associated with the Tie-breaker closing sequence. The timer M84t was not functioning properly. The contact changeover was not happening in the timer as intended.</li>
                <li>The timer was changed, and the problem was solved.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Recommended Solution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Check all the timers and their changeovers. Similar problems were faced by multiple vessels, and mostly timers are at fault.</li>
                <li>Ensure timely inspections of the ACBs.</li>
