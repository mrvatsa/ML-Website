            <h2>Auxiliary Engine 2 Power Factor Issue</h2>
            <ul class="description">
                <li>AE2 was observed running with an unusually low power factor (0.1â€“0.3) during vessel maneuvering, despite similar loads across all three auxiliary engines.</li>
                <li>The current drawn by AE2 was significantly higher than AE1 and AE3 for comparable loads, indicating inefficiency.</li>
                <li>The low power factor issue persisted when AE2 was operated in parallel with AE1 and AE3, regardless of configuration.</li>
                <li>While the vessel's operations were not impacted immediately, the abnormal performance raised concerns about equipment reliability during critical maneuvers.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="case-details">
            <h2>Solution Summary</h2>
            <ul class="description">
                <li>A service engineer conducted a thorough investigation and identified that AE2's no-load voltage was set at 462.2 volts, which was higher than the recommended setting.</li>
                <li>The no-load voltage for all three auxiliary engines was adjusted to 450 volts to ensure uniformity.</li>
                <li>Post-adjustment, all generators were tested under load conditions from the stern and bow thrusters. The tests confirmed smooth operation, equal load sharing, and improved power factor as the load increased.</li>
                <li>The service engineer advised rechecking the no-load voltage every two years to prevent similar deviations and ensure continued reliability.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Last Section -->
        <section class="solution">
            <h2>Recommended Solution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Check the no-load voltage of each generator and align it with standard settings.</li>
                <li>If the no-load voltage is correct, inspect the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) for potential faults and replace if necessary.</li>
